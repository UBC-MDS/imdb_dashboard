# Proposal for the IMDB movie ratings dashboard

## Motivation and purpose

Our role: Data consultancy firm

Target audience: A movie producer looking for ideas for their next film.

The global film industry is a multi-billion dollar industry which produces hundreds of movies each year.
Many of these movies are not highly rated and thus are not particularly enjoyed by audiences.
However, some movies perform exceptionally well and receive extremely high ratings from many movie-watchers.
Our client is looking to make an impact in the film industry by producing a new movie with the highest ratings possible.
They want to be remembered as a fantastic producer, so they are really focusing on movie ratings rather than how much revenue of profit they generate.
Our dashboard will show the various factors that affect a movie's rating and will allow the producer to explore and filter the data to see which characteristics of a movie make it most likely to be highly rated.
This will enable the producer to know how to design their movie such that it receives high ratings from many people.

## Description of the data

## Research questions and usage scenarios

Tom is one of the top movie producers in Hollywood. He produced a number of Oscar award winning movies and his latest movie "MDS" won 7 academy awards. He is determined to break the record of 11 academy awards won by a movie. In view of his achievements in the past years, Tom receives great support from investors, so he is not concerned about the budget and profit. With the aim to make the best movie ever, he wants to know,
1. Which genre would be highly rated? What is the past trend?
2. Is modern movies better?
3. Which actors should be chosen?
4. Which country produce the best movies?

When Tom logs on to the imdb_dashboard app, he will see a worldmap showing the average movie rating across countries. Also, he can compare movie rating across different genres. There are also plots showing average movie ratings over time and top rated movies by actors. There are additional functions in the navigation pane that he can filter the movies by year, actor, genre and location. The plots will also be interactive that users can get more information by hovering over a point in the plots.

By using the app, Tom will have his questions answered and hopefully he can have a clearer picture on what makes the best movie!
