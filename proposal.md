# Proposal for the IMDB movie ratings dashboard

## Motivation and purpose

Our role: Data consultancy firm

Target audience: A movie producer looking for ideas for their next film.

The global film industry is a multi-billion dollar industry which produces hundreds of movies each year.
Many of these movies are not highly rated and thus are not particularly enjoyed by audiences.
However, some movies perform exceptionally well and receive extremely high ratings from many movie-watchers.
Our client is looking to make an impact in the film industry by producing a new movie with the highest ratings possible.
They want to be remembered as a fantastic producer, so they are really focusing on movie ratings rather than how much revenue of profit they generate.
Our dashboard will show the various factors that affect a movie's rating and will allow the producer to explore and filter the data to see which characteristics of a movie make it most likely to be highly rated.
This will enable the producer to know how to design their movie such that it receives high ratings from many people.
