## Dashboard description

Our dashboard consists of one web page that shows 4 main reactive plots:

- The top rated movies by genre
- How movie ratings vary over time
- The top rated movies by actor
- A map showing summary statistics about movies produced in each region

We include a set of filters in a navigation pane on the left-hand side which allows used to filter the dataset by year, by actors, by genres, or by location. Changing these filters will update the data that is used to generate the plots. The displayed charts will be interactive enabling users to get more granular information by hovering over a point in a scatterplot or a bar in a bar graph.
