## Section 3: Research questions and usage scenarios

Tom is one of the top movie producers in Hollywood. He produced a number of Oscar award winning movies and his latest movie "MDS" won 7 academy awards. He is determined to break the record of 11 academy awards won by a movie. In view of his achievements in the past years, Tom also got great support from investors. With the aim to make the best movie ever, he wants to know,
1. Which genre would be more popular? What is the past trend?
2. Is modern movies better?
3. Which actors should be chosen?
4. Which genre is less competitive?
5. Which country produce the best movies?

When Tom logs on to the imdb_dashboard app, he will see a worldmap showing the average movie rating across countries. Also, he can compare movie rating across different genres and years. There are also plots showing average movie ratings over time, movie rating distribution for selected actors and proportion of movies by genre over time.

By using the app, Tom will have his questions answered and hopefully he can have a clearer picture on what makes the best movie!
